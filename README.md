# SICC
SICC is a SDN-based Incast Congestion Control Framework for Data Centre Networks. 
Specifically, it aims at detecting incast in timely manner and achieving coperation between the network SDN controller and hypervisor to perform control rate of TCP during incast 

It is implemented as a netwok application running on top of Ryu-Controller as well as a small Patch to OpenvSwitch datapath.
